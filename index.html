                <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup 
                language[a] for documents designed to be displayed in a web
                browser. It defines the content and structure of web 
                content. It is often assisted by technologies such as 
                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such 
                as JavaScript, a programming language.</p>
                <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server 
                or from local storage and render the documents into
                multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web 
                page semantically and originally included cues for its 
                appearance.</p>
                <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. 
                With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as 
                interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. 
                HTML provides a means to create structured documents by 
                denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, 
                paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML 
                elements are delineated by tags, written using angle 
                brackets. Tags such as &lt;img&gt; and &lt;input&gt; directly introduce 
                content into the page. Other tags such as &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; 
                surround and provide information about document text and may 
                include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML 
                tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>
                <p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such 
                as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web 
                pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of 
                content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer
                of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has 
                encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since
                1997.[3] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video 
                and audio, primarily using the element, together with 
                JavaScript.</p>
